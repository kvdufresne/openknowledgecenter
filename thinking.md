# Things we are writing and researching

Micah's ["Defining Social Impact"](https://medium.com/accelerating-the-social-impact-of-research/defining-social-impact-1a68a18f5314):

"I’m doing quite a bit of reading about social or societal impact connected to open science. The easiest starting point, and one that is not uncommon, is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are the clearest outline of the wicked problems facing humanity, and offer helpful hooks on which to hang our collective work.
But, we all know that societal impact is larger and more nuanced than any list could capture, and arguably some versions of societal impact may be intangible and ephemeral. As I trawl through the current research and thinking, my goal is to less to boil down an agreed upon definition and more to cultivate an imagination for how to increase the permeability of the wall between the Ivory Tower and Main Street."

Kelsey's ["Digital Pedagogy Lab: 2021"](https://kvdufresne.medium.com/digital-pedagogy-lab-2021-b86eb41eb8e3):

"Inclusive Design, Design Justice, and Striving for Equity. How can we strive for equity, access, and inclusion in our learning spaces, in our institutional designs, and in our everyday decisions? Inclusive design and design justice, as taught through the Digital Pedagogy Lab, encourage us to ask questions such as this — and then work together to make it happen. While providing a contextual overview of Digital Pedagogy Lab’s Inclusive Design and Design Justice track, I also outline key takeaways of inclusive design and design justice as well as opportunities for library and classroom implementation."
